## How long did it take me?
It takes over 2 hours. There is a problem about \n and \r when I am clicking "enter" in the windows system. It is so horrible. Takes much time to solve that.

## What "bells and whistles" did you implement as part of your script?
It can help you to copy a file to a folder

## [optional] What did I like about this lab?
It teaches me how to make myself a proper sh

## [optional] What would I change about this lab?
Time is quite limited for TA to go through all the content throughly. Suggest dividing this lecture into two.
