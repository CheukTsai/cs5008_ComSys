# Lab2 - CS5008 - Zhuocai Li
## Who did I work with? 
I worked with Kejian (Oliver) with the help of our TA. Thanks them both a lot \n
for helping me solve so much problems!

## What external resources did I use? 
-http://c.biancheng.net/view/1832.html 
-http://c.biancheng.net/cpp/html/80.html 
and many other resources(websites) that I failed to copy and paste.

## How long did it take me?
It takes over 4 hours because I stucked in how to print out 
an integer array. Tried lots of methods to print out the example.

## [optional] What did I like about this lab?
The main point is to understand the differences between 
C and other languges.

## [optional] What would I change about this lab?
I think it would be better if the lecturer can throw out 
some problems first and ask us to solve them. Then we can 
have better understanding about things.
