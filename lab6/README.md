## Who did I work with? 
This is not a very hard mission, mainly work with the instructions

## What external resources did I use? 
- https://www.runoob.com/cprogramming/c-strings.html
- https://github.com/google/googletest

## How long did it take me?
For the must-do part, tt takes me about 30 minutes to understand all the files and their functions. 15 minutes to design function and do the test.

## [optional] What did I like about this lab?
It is very important to get the chance to test what I have coded. Otherwise, many mistakes will be brought to later codings.

## [optional] What would I change about this lab?
I think TAs and the instructions already help me a lot. Thanks!
