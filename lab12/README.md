These are two articles that helps me better understand graphs and Dijkstra's algorithm.

## what data structure choices you made
I use node to collect usable data and also list to collect node.

## Output example
Please run by "make".

# What did you like about this assignment?
A good and visual way to understand graph and Dijkstra's algorithm, also TAs are patient to answer all questions and give correct examples of the implementation.

# What could be improved about this assignment?
So far so good!
